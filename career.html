        Peace Corps in Colombia<br />
        <i>April 2019 - Present</i><br />
      </div>
      <div class="caption hide">
        <p>I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer promoting economic development in Colombia for about a year. My work included giving entrepreneurship and personal finance classes, organizing and facilitating a community savings group, supporting a nonprofit’s micro-loan program, and advising small businesses and community associations in my site.</p>
        <p>I also addressed Peace Corps Colombia’s secondary objectives during service, namely youth and technology. I led a boys’ club, a girls’ club, and an after-school tech club in my site. I was also a member of the ICT4D (Information and Communication Technology for Development) committee, which involved preparing for and presenting at an annual conference about utilizing technology for business and education in Colombia.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I was evacuated mid-way through my service due to the COVID-19 pandemic and didn’t get to see through all the plans I had.</p>

                Data Scientist in DC<br />

            <div class="caption hide">
                <p>From January 2018 to March 2019, I was a Data Scientist in Washington, DC. I worked at Booz Allen Hamilton and was on a project supporting the Department of Labor’s financial system. I initially diagnosed and resolved issues experienced by users of the financial system as a Financial Systems Analyst. During this time, I created an application that automates data integration tasks and performs diagnostics for common user issues.</p>
                <p>I became a developer on my project shortly thereafter. While in this role, I initiated and built a tool that automates the migration of reports between software platforms and that facilitates the development of new reports that are generated by the financial system. This tool initially saved about 70 man-hours during a reporting modernization initiative requested by the Department of Labor. It’s also a resource that will be used to develop new reports in the future.</p>

                <p>UrbanPromise Wilmington is a non-profit that puts on summer camps and after-school programs for inner city kids in Wilmington, DE, a city with one of the highest murder rates per capita in the U.S. I was an intern at this organization for 7 months from June through December 2017. During the summer, I was on staff at a summer camp for children in elementary school. In the fall, I was an Assistant Director at an after-school program for middle schoolers.</p>
                <p>While I was at UrbanPromise, I built an interactive map showing the organization’s presence amidst all the violence in Wilmington. This map was used in fundraising literature and presented during the keynote speaker's speech at the organization’s annual banquet. I also designed and implemented a survey to collect data on outcomes of UrbanPromise’s teen job training program. I then used this data to produce statistics and data visualizations for a grant application that led to the receipt of a $50K award.</p>

            <div class="caption hide">
                <p>I graduated from William & Mary with a BA in Economics in May 2016. My coursework emphasized quantitative skills (math and econometrics) and foreign language study (Spanish and French). During my time in college, I took jazz piano lessons and studied abroad in Spain twice.</p>
                <p>Following undergrad, I enrolled in the Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) program at William & Mary’s business school. Participating in this program was what sparked my interest in data science. For my capstone project, I utilized machine learning and natural language processing to classify international development projects into one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals set by the UN. I graduated from the program in May 2017.</p>
